# Tiny-IDS: Tiny-IDS: A Tiny Deep Neural Network-based Intrusion Detection System
In this repo, we provide the scripts of a DNN-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that can be utilized in Embedded Systems due to its small number of weights. We used the CIC-IDS2017 dataset to validate the proposed method.
