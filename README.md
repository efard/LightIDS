In this repo, we provide the scripts of the paper "LightIDS: A Lightweight Neural Network-based Intrusion Detection System" a DNN-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that can be utilized in Embedded Systems due to its small number of weights.  

We used the [CIC-IDS2017](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html) dataset to validate the proposed method. For more details on code, you can take a look at [this paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-021-00567-2), and also [this repo](https://github.com/INL-Laboratory/Continual-Federated-IDS).

We ran our code on Ubuntu 24.04, and the required packages are in the requirement.txt file. It is recommended to run the code in a virtual environment. 

By running the code, you should see something like this at first:

Notably, they are only samples, and you may see different results by using the whole dataset.
